# Working on this repo

A few standing instructions for Claude Code sessions.

How the owner actually works — what "done" means, what counts as
evidence, settled chart/ledger rules, past mistakes — is
`.claude/skills/working-with-davies/SKILL.md` (auto-loaded). Cursor
loads the same text from `.cursor/rules/working-with-davies.mdc`. The
raw session is `handover.md`.

## Documentation

- **Keep `README.md` in sync as part of every change** — don't wait to
  be asked. When a change adds/removes an Edge Function, migration,
  `src/` module, workflow, or a user-facing feature, update the matching
  README section (Highlights / Stack / File map / migrations table) in
  the same commit or PR. Trim redundant/outdated prose while you're
  there. The README is the source-of-truth map of the system; a change
  that lands without its README update is incomplete.

## The handover document

`handover.md` is the running record of work on this repo, and it is
**maintained in real time** — not written up at the end. A session that
dies mid-task (context exhausted, container reclaimed, tab closed) has
to leave the next one, human or model, able to pick up from that file
alone.

Update it as you go, at these moments:

- **Before starting** substantive work — write the plan into Part 1's
  open items, so an interrupted session leaves an intention behind, not
  a mystery.
- **When state changes** — a branch moved, a PR opened, a migration
  applied, a gate went red. Rewrite Part 1 to be true right now.
- **When a decision is made** — append to Part 2 with the reason and the
  cost, and name the alternative you rejected. Never rewrite a past
  entry; add one that supersedes it and say which.
- **When a review comes back** — Codex, another AI, or the owner saying
  a number is wrong. Record what was claimed, what you accepted, what
  you rejected, and why.
- **Before you finish** — reconcile Part 1 against what actually
  happened, and leave the open items honest. "I didn't get to X" is
  worth more than silence.

Keep `.claude/skills/working-with-davies/SKILL.md` (and its two Cursor
copies) in step whenever a session learns something durable about how
the owner works, or pays for a mistake worth not repeating. The skill is
the distilled agreement; `handover.md` is the evidence behind it.

Do not copy live balances out of `handover.md` into new files, issues,
or anything public. The repo is private; that file quotes real
positions.

## Git workflow

- **Push `main` directly.** No feature branch, no PR, unless he
  explicitly asks for Codex review. Each commit is its own logical
  unit; if the work spans multiple concerns, split into multiple
  commits before pushing.
- **PR only when he asks.** `@codex` only reviews PRs — e.g. a new
  Edge Function, anything that touches `auth` or migration state, if
  he wants that second look. Don't open one otherwise.
- Run `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run build` locally
  before every push — only push if all three are green.
- Cloudflare Pages and the `typecheck-and-build` GitHub Action run on
  every push. If a push leaves `main` red, fix-up commit on `main` is
  the next priority — don't move on to new features while CI is broken.
- Never force-push `main` and never bypass hooks (`--no-verify`)
  without explicit user confirmation in the same message.
- Keep commit messages focused on **why**, not **what**.
- **Commit as the repo owner, never as Claude / Anthropic.** Every
  GitHub contribution must land in the owner's name so the graph
  reflects them. At the start of each session set the git identity
  before committing:
  `git config user.name "daviesluo" && git config user.email "daviesluo@gmail.com"`
  (containers clone fresh, so this resets every session — set it each
  time). Do NOT author/commit as `Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`, and
  do NOT add a `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` trailer.

## Edge Function deploys

`.github/workflows/edge-functions.yml` auto-deploys every changed
`supabase/functions/<name>/index.ts` on push to `main`, gated by
`deno test supabase/functions/`. Requires repo secrets
`SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` (account PAT) and `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF`
(project ref id). When a commit changes an Edge Function:

1. Add / update the matching `index.test.ts` so the pure helpers stay
   pinned — the workflow's deploy step won't run if `deno test` fails.
2. Commit + push as usual. The workflow takes care of the deploy.
3. Verify in the Supabase dashboard → Edge Functions list that the
   "Last updated" timestamp jumped to the deploy run.

If the deploy secrets are missing or revoked the workflow logs a
warning and exits 0 — the push doesn't go red, but production stays
on the previous version. Fallback in that case: paste the new
`index.ts` into Supabase dashboard → Edge Functions manually, same as
the pre-CI workflow.

The `Deno.serve(...)` entry in each `index.ts` is wrapped in
`if (import.meta.main)`. Preserve that guard — without it, importing
the function's pure helpers from `index.test.ts` would bind a port.

## Testing

- `npm run typecheck` — tsc with `checkJs` + `strictNullChecks`, no type
  errors should slip through. The `useState(null)` / `useRef(null)` slots
  carry JSDoc `@type` annotations; keep new ones annotated.
- `npm run lint` — ESLint (flat config, `eslint.config.js`). A bug gate,
  not a formatter: errors on `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`, warns on
  `exhaustive-deps` (a few effects intentionally narrow their deps). Runs
  in CI between typecheck and test.
- `npm test` — vitest. ~400 cases covering: YTD chart math, fetch /
  proxy strategy, ticker-shape predicates, cache TTL + LRU, per-proxy
  backoff, market-cache + legacy fallback, SW banner suppression
  window, ops-badge desktop gate, portfolio user-fingerprint diffing,
  T212 sync application, and the chart-modal indicator math (MA /
  VWAP / TTM-EPS-P/E / extended-hours-bar detection). Add a pin
  test whenever a regression is fixed so the bug can't quietly come
  back.
- `npm run build` — Vite production bundle, output to repo root.
- `deno test --allow-env supabase/functions/` — Edge Function pin
  tests. Required locally before pushing changes to any
  `supabase/functions/<name>/index.ts`; CI runs the same on every PR
  and push to main. Each function's pure helpers are `export`ed and
  pinned by a co-located `index.test.ts`.

When refactoring chart math, add a test pinning the formula's output
for the affected case so the YTD bugs (+80% / +21% / +9% misreports)
can't quietly come back. Same rule applies to Edge Function helpers
— extract the pure logic and pin it in `index.test.ts`.

Note: `vitest` 4 runs the suite under its own bundled Vite (rolldown /
oxc), which is a different major than the `vite@5` used by `npm run
build`. That mismatch is the source of the harmless `esbuild option …
deprecated, please use oxc` warnings at the top of a test run — tests
and the prod bundle transpile through different pipelines, so a
transpile-sensitive change is worth eyeballing in a real `npm run
build` too, not just under vitest.

## Storage

Persisted state lives under the `dp.*` namespace with a single schema
version (`Storage.migrate()` in `src/storage.js`). When the data shape
changes, bump `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` in `src/storage.js` and add a
migration step instead of inventing a new key.

## Pull requests

Codex's `@codex` bot reviews PRs only, not direct commits to `main`.
Default is direct push; the owner catches issues via Cloudflare
preview deploys and real-world testing. Open a PR only when he asks
for Codex — then wait for the review and respond to
`get_review_comments` before merging. The T212 rollout (PR #129)
caught both the per-share-vs-total cost bug and the boundary-race
concern this way.

**While a PR is open its description is part of the branch, and it is
maintained the way `handover.md` is — in real time.** Every push that
changes the diff rewrites the description in the same step, before the
turn ends. Never leave it describing the previous push: it is read as
the current state of the branch, so a stale one actively misinforms.

Each rewrite has to leave these true:

- **It describes only what the PR would add to `main` right now.** Work
  that lands on `main` separately stops being this PR's work — take it
  out of the summary, and out of the branch. **Rebase onto `main`;
  don't merge `main` in.** A merge drags `main`'s own commits into the
  PR's commit list, where they read as unreviewed work the PR is
  proposing.
- The commit table matches the commits. Rewrite it whenever the history
  is rewritten.
- The test plan names what was actually run against the tree being
  pushed — the gates, the browser verification, the counterfactuals.
- Risks say what merging does to production: a migration
  `migrations.yml` will apply, an Edge Function that redeploys, a
  behaviour change that touches live data.
- **The Cloudflare Pages preview link is in it**, near the top, so the
  branch can be checked on a real machine before it merges.

Cloudflare Pages aliases every branch to
`https://<slug>.daviesportfolios.pages.dev`, where `<slug>` is the
branch name lowercased with every non-alphanumeric run collapsed to `-`
and truncated to 28 characters — `claude/repo-audit-restore-uverhn`
becomes `claude-repo-audit-restore-uv`. Verify it before quoting it:
fetch the URL and check the `assets/app-<hash>.js` it references is the
one committed on the branch, not the one on `main`.
