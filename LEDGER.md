# Ledger

The live handover record for this repository, under the ledger protocol
in `.ledger/SKILL.md`. Read this file first on any resume; it is kept
small on purpose. The deep record — the full decision log and the raw
session transcripts — is `handover.md`, which is this ledger's ARCHIVE
and is opened only when a closed item is reopened or audited.

## What remains right now

1. **After a full day of `price_snapshots` recording, check the
   `RECORDED` provenance rule has walked left across the 24H window** on
   the Investment Performance panel. The table has been filling since
   2026-08-19; nothing has confirmed the panel draws the recorded
   stretch at the width it should.
2. **Re-check the AH-trust fix against a live fast mover.** `5ddd1ac`
   made `ahQuoteTolerance` scale with the tape after BE read an em dash
   on the heat map. It was verified against Friday's frozen after-hours
   data only — the market was shut. The first real test is the Sunday
   20:00 ET overnight reopen, on a name actually moving.
3. **Decide what `Model:` carries in this ledger's source headers.** The
   protocol wants the exact model in every header. This session runs
   under an operator rule that forbids putting a model identifier into
   anything pushed to a repository, so its headers say
   `not recorded (session policy)`. A session without that rule should
   write the real model. Davies decides whether to backfill.
4. **Issue #207** (`edge-functions failed on main`, opened 2026-08-18)
   is stale — that workflow has been green on every push since. Close it
   or leave it for the next real failure to bump.

Nothing else is in flight. `main` is clean and pushed.

## Machine and platform setup

A rebuilt container loses every line below. Run them before working.

    git config user.name "daviesluo"
    git config user.email daviesluo@gmail.com
    git config core.hooksPath hooks
    git config --local ledger.path LEDGER.md
    npm ci

Facts a fresh session would otherwise rediscover:

- **Node 22** (`.nvmrc`). npm 10.x.
- **The Edge Function tests run under `npx deno`**, currently Deno 2.9.6
  here: `npx deno test --allow-env supabase/functions/`. `AGENTS.md` says
  to prefer Deno 1.x to match Supabase's runtime; the npx path is what
  actually works in this container and what every gate run below used.
- **The browser harnesses need Playwright, which the app does not depend
  on.** Chromium is preinstalled at `/opt/pw-browsers`; do not run
  `playwright install`. Set them up once per container:

        mkdir -p /tmp/h && cd /tmp/h && echo '{"type":"module"}' > package.json
        PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 npm i playwright
        cp /path/to/repo/scraps/verify-*.mjs . && node verify-app-sweep.mjs /path/to/repo

- **The container clock has been wrong before.** On 2026-09-05 it read
  91 minutes behind the database, and that alone produced a false outage
  report. On anything time-gated, take the time and the WEEKDAY from the
  database (`select now()`), not from `date`.
- **Gates, all of which must pass before a push:** `npm run typecheck`,
  `npm run lint`, `npm test` — **check the exit code, not the summary
  line** — `npm run build` followed by
  `rm -f assets/*.map sw.js.map workbox-*.js.map`, `npx size-limit`,
  `npx knip`, and `npx deno test --allow-env supabase/functions/` when an
  Edge Function changed.

## History, newest first

Closed operations move verbatim into `handover.md`, whose Part 2
(decision log) and Part 3 (transcripts) are this ledger's archive.
Everything before 2026-09-05 lives there already.

### [2026-09-05 09:25 UTC] Platform: Claude Code | Model: not recorded (session policy)

Adopted the ledger protocol as this repository's working record, from
`https://github.com/daviesluo/ledger-skill` at `697b8b2`.

The package sits at `.ledger/`, which no tool scans, and the two
pointers it ships with were deleted per its README — copying it onto
`.claude/skills/ledger/` would have put the protocol where a pointer
belongs and a pointer would then have replaced it. Pointers written at
the three paths this repo's tools actually scan, each carrying the
protocol's own front matter and a corrected relative path.

`sh .ledger/bin/selftest.sh` passes 47 cases here, so the hook is known
good on this machine before anything depended on it. Installed at
`hooks/pre-commit` with `core.hooksPath`; there was no previous hook to
append to.

The split with `handover.md` is the one design decision worth recording.
That file is 35,138 lines, which is exactly what the protocol's economy
rule forbids in a file read on every resume. So it keeps its role as the
deep record and becomes the archive, and this ledger carries only what a
resuming session needs. `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` were rewritten to
name one live record rather than two, because two handover documents
maintained in parallel is the failure this protocol exists to prevent,
not a stricter version of it.

### [2026-09-05 09:25 UTC] Platform: Claude Code | Model: not recorded (session policy)

State inherited into this ledger, so the first resume has a recorded
point to verify against: `main` at `5ddd1ac`, clean, pushed.

`5ddd1ac` fixed the AH-trust guard — `extPriceIsRealAh` accepted an
extended-hours quote only within a flat 3 % of the last bar, and BE ran
8.96 % across 2026-09-04's after-hours with a single 8.76 % five-minute
bar, so a real print was thrown out and the heat-map tile read an em
dash. Tolerance now scales off the stock's own recent bars, floored at
3 % and capped at 15 %. The pin fails on the flat threshold; a
quiet-tape control with the identical 3.16 % gap still fails, which is
what keeps the SFTBY protection intact.

Before it, `fed622e` stopped `snapshot-record` writing Yahoo's frozen
overnight quote when the T212 call came back empty, and migration `0035`
stripped the rows already written. PR #209 merged at `3f3aa11`; its
rollout was verified against production rather than assumed.

One correction belongs in the record because it was told to the owner
wrongly first: the overnight recorder writing nothing since Friday
03:55 ET is the weekend dead zone working as designed, not an outage.
cron fired 360/360, every HTTP response was 200, and `shouldRecord`
correctly returned false from Friday 20:00 ET. The wrong call came from
reading the container clock and not checking the weekday.
