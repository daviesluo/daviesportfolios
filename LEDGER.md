# Ledger

The live handover record for this repository, under the ledger protocol
in `.ledger/SKILL.md`. Read this file first on any resume; it is kept
small on purpose. The deep record — the full decision log and the raw
session transcripts — is `handover.md`, which is this ledger's ARCHIVE
and is opened only when a closed item is reopened or audited.

## What remains right now

**The full plan is `docs/improvement-plan.md`** — 28 items in four
tiers, written 2026-09-05 from a whole-repository review, with cost,
risk and a verification step on each. It is a PROPOSAL: nothing in it
has been executed, and nothing should be until Davies confirms. This
list stays the short version; the plan is the reasoning behind it.

1. **THE LIVE SITE PUBLISHES THE WHOLE REPOSITORY, AND STILL DOES.**
   Re-measured 2026-09-05: `handover.md`, `LEDGER.md`, all of `src/`,
   `supabase/functions/*` and the migration carrying purchase records
   all return 200 to an unauthenticated fetch, with
   `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.

   The earlier diagnosis in this ledger was WRONG, and that is why two
   fixes failed. `wrangler.jsonc`'s `assets.directory` is a **Workers**
   key; this is a **Pages** project and ignores it (wrangler is not even
   a dependency). The root serves because NO build output directory is
   configured anywhere and the Pages default is the repository root.
   Same reason `.assetsignore` (a Workers mechanism) and `_redirects`
   (cannot beat a real static asset) both did nothing.

   It is fixable IN-REPO after all, without the dashboard: point Vite's
   `outDir` at `../dist`, move the committed bundle there, and add
   `"pages_build_output_dir": "./dist"` to `wrangler.jsonc`. Verify on
   the branch PREVIEW first — app loads with the branch's asset hash,
   and `/handover.md` returns 404 — then merge. Plan item 1 has the
   steps. Afterwards, rotate both app passwords and the token-signing
   secret: the Edge sources were public. No sign anyone found it — five
   failed logins in the auth table's whole history, none in 30 days.

2. **After a full day of `price_snapshots` recording, check the
   `RECORDED` provenance rule has walked left across the 24H window** on
   the Investment Performance panel. The table has been filling since
   2026-08-19; nothing has confirmed the panel draws the recorded
   stretch at the width it should.
3. **Re-check the AH-trust fix against a live fast mover.** `5ddd1ac`
   made `ahQuoteTolerance` scale with the tape after BE read an em dash
   on the heat map. It was verified against Friday's frozen after-hours
   data only — the market was shut. The first real test is the Sunday
   20:00 ET overnight reopen, on a name actually moving.
4. **Decide what `Model:` carries in this ledger's source headers.** The
   protocol wants the exact model in every header. This session runs
   under an operator rule that forbids putting a model identifier into
   anything pushed to a repository, so its headers say
   `not recorded (session policy)`. A session without that rule should
   write the real model. Davies decides whether to backfill.
5. **Issue #207** (`edge-functions failed on main`, opened 2026-08-18)
   is stale — that workflow has been green on every push since. Close it
   or leave it for the next real failure to bump.

Nothing else is in flight. `main` is clean and pushed.

## Machine and platform setup

A rebuilt container loses every line below. Run them before working.

    git config user.name "daviesluo"
    git config user.email daviesluo@gmail.com
    git config core.hooksPath hooks
    git config --local ledger.path LEDGER.md
    npm ci

Facts a fresh session would otherwise rediscover:

- **Node 22** (`.nvmrc`). npm 10.x.
- **The Edge Function tests run under `npx deno`**, currently Deno 2.9.6
  here: `npx deno test --allow-env supabase/functions/`. `AGENTS.md` says
  to prefer Deno 1.x to match Supabase's runtime; the npx path is what
  actually works in this container and what every gate run below used.
- **The browser harnesses need Playwright, which the app does not depend
  on.** Chromium is preinstalled at `/opt/pw-browsers`; do not run
  `playwright install`. Set them up once per container:

        mkdir -p /tmp/h && cd /tmp/h && echo '{"type":"module"}' > package.json
        PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 npm i playwright
        cp /path/to/repo/scraps/verify-*.mjs . && node verify-app-sweep.mjs /path/to/repo

- **The container clock has been wrong before.** On 2026-09-05 it read
  91 minutes behind the database, and that alone produced a false outage
  report. On anything time-gated, take the time and the WEEKDAY from the
  database (`select now()`), not from `date`.
- **Gates, all of which must pass before a push:** `npm run typecheck`,
  `npm run lint`, `npm test` — **check the exit code, not the summary
  line** — `npm run build` followed by
  `rm -f assets/*.map sw.js.map workbox-*.js.map`, `npx size-limit`,
  `npx knip`, and `npx deno test --allow-env supabase/functions/` when an
  Edge Function changed.

## History, newest first

Closed operations move verbatim into `handover.md`, whose Part 2
(decision log) and Part 3 (transcripts) are this ledger's archive.
Everything before 2026-09-05 lives there already.

### [2026-09-05 22:17 UTC] Platform: Claude Code | Model: not recorded (session policy)

Whole-repository review, recorded as `docs/improvement-plan.md` and NOT
executed — Davies asked for the plan before any of the work.

Two things the review changed about what this ledger already said.

The exposure diagnosis in item 1 was wrong. `assets.directory` in
`wrangler.jsonc` is a Cloudflare WORKERS key and a Pages project ignores
it; wrangler is not a dependency here and that file's `$schema` points
at a path that does not exist. Nothing in the repository was configuring
the upload at all — the Pages default is the repository root. Which
means `pages_build_output_dir` (the Pages key, absent) is an in-repo fix
after all, verifiable on a branch preview, and the dashboard is not
required. It also explains both failed attempts in one sentence rather
than two.

And the exposure is worse than "the position history is public": the
Edge Function sources are public too, including a header comment that
describes the app's own credential design. Rotation is part of the fix,
not a precaution.

Four findings were verified in the source rather than taken from the
review: the two ledger reconciliations in `ytd.js` and
`deposit_series.js` genuinely differ (run both on one synthetic holding
and the value line dates the whole position at the window start while
the deposited line keeps the real lots); the save path advances its
saved-fingerprint marker before awaiting the save, so a non-conflict
failure is never retried in that tab; the cross-tab reload lacks the
demo-book guard the mount path has; and the snapshot recorder is missing
from `PUBLIC_FNS` while its own header says it must be there. That last
one is latent, not live — `price_snapshots` had a row one minute old
when checked, so the CLI is still preserving the setting.

Measured baseline for the next session to compare against: 764 unit
cases and 208 Edge cases green, knip clean, 120.29 kB gzipped against
the 122 kB budget, six cron jobs with no failures in 24 h.

### [2026-09-05 10:05 UTC] Platform: Claude Code | Model: not recorded (session policy)

Both in-repo attempts at stopping the repo-wide publication failed, and
the measurements are worth keeping so nobody repeats them.

`.assetsignore` (f010fed): ignored. The proof is that the platform
served `/.assetsignore` itself with a 200 — it treated the exclusion
list as one more asset. That mechanism belongs to Workers static
assets; this project deploys as Pages from the repo root, and the
`wrangler.jsonc` beside it is not what drives the upload.

`_redirects` 404 rules (e78431b): ignored for these paths. `_headers`
IS applied on this project, so the special files are parsed; a redirect
simply does not override an existing static asset on Pages.
`/handover.md` and `/src/app.jsx` both stayed 200 across fourteen polls
over seven minutes, with the deploy confirmed live (the site's own copy
of `LEDGER.md` already carried this sitting's newest entry). The site
itself stayed healthy throughout, which is the only good news here.

Both files removed in this commit. What remains is a dashboard change,
written out in item 1, and it needs Davies.

### [2026-09-05 09:45 UTC] Platform: Claude Code | Model: not recorded (session policy)

The live site was publishing the whole repository, and had been for as
long as these files existed. `wrangler.jsonc` sets `assets.directory`
to `.`, so Cloudflare uploads the repo root and serves it. Measured
against production, not inferred: `/handover.md` returned 200 with the
real position history, `/supabase/migrations/0033_mark_other_platform_lots.sql`
returned the actual purchase records in its comments, and `/src/*`,
`/supabase/functions/*`, `/CLAUDE.md` and `/.env.example` were all
readable by anyone. `.git/` was not served. The app is password-gated;
the files sitting beside it were not.

Found while checking whether today's own additions (`hooks/`,
`.ledger/`) had become public — they had, which is how the older and
much worse exposure surfaced.

`.assetsignore` now names what must not ship. Written as a DENY-list
rather than an allow-list deliberately: a missed exclusion leaves one
file public and takes a minute to fix, a missed allow takes the live
site down. It is unverified at the time of writing — item 1 of what
remains is fetching the deploy and requiring 404.

### [2026-09-05 09:25 UTC] Platform: Claude Code | Model: not recorded (session policy)

Adopted the ledger protocol as this repository's working record, from
`https://github.com/daviesluo/ledger-skill` at `697b8b2`.

The package sits at `.ledger/`, which no tool scans, and the two
pointers it ships with were deleted per its README — copying it onto
`.claude/skills/ledger/` would have put the protocol where a pointer
belongs and a pointer would then have replaced it. Pointers written at
the three paths this repo's tools actually scan, each carrying the
protocol's own front matter and a corrected relative path.

`sh .ledger/bin/selftest.sh` passes 47 cases here, so the hook is known
good on this machine before anything depended on it. Installed at
`hooks/pre-commit` with `core.hooksPath`; there was no previous hook to
append to.

The split with `handover.md` is the one design decision worth recording.
That file is 35,138 lines, which is exactly what the protocol's economy
rule forbids in a file read on every resume. So it keeps its role as the
deep record and becomes the archive, and this ledger carries only what a
resuming session needs. `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` were rewritten to
name one live record rather than two, because two handover documents
maintained in parallel is the failure this protocol exists to prevent,
not a stricter version of it.

### [2026-09-05 09:25 UTC] Platform: Claude Code | Model: not recorded (session policy)

State inherited into this ledger, so the first resume has a recorded
point to verify against: `main` at `5ddd1ac`, clean, pushed.

`5ddd1ac` fixed the AH-trust guard — `extPriceIsRealAh` accepted an
extended-hours quote only within a flat 3 % of the last bar, and BE ran
8.96 % across 2026-09-04's after-hours with a single 8.76 % five-minute
bar, so a real print was thrown out and the heat-map tile read an em
dash. Tolerance now scales off the stock's own recent bars, floored at
3 % and capped at 15 %. The pin fails on the flat threshold; a
quiet-tape control with the identical 3.16 % gap still fails, which is
what keeps the SFTBY protection intact.

Before it, `fed622e` stopped `snapshot-record` writing Yahoo's frozen
overnight quote when the T212 call came back empty, and migration `0035`
stripped the rows already written. PR #209 merged at `3f3aa11`; its
rollout was verified against production rather than assumed.

One correction belongs in the record because it was told to the owner
wrongly first: the overnight recorder writing nothing since Friday
03:55 ET is the weekend dead zone working as designed, not an outage.
cron fired 360/360, every HTTP response was 200, and `shouldRecord`
correctly returned false from Friday 20:00 ET. The wrong call came from
reading the container clock and not checking the weekday.
